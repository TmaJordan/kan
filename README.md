## Problem Statement
Agents spend much of their time updating managers and trying to organise information related to tasks manually. This time could be better spent completing their assigned tasks. Managers have no visibility into the progress or status of individual tasks without emailing or calling the owner of the task. This time could be better spent ensuring that projects are completed on-time.
## Mission Statement
The app will keep all of the information required for a task connected to the task and provide a simple view for agents to complete their workload in order of priority and in a timely manner. Managers will be able to view the progress of individual tasks as well as the current workload of each agent, ensuring that tasks are allocated in an efficient and fair manner.
